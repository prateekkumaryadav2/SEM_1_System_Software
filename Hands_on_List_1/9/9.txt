Q 1) is no of hardlinks by default 1?

Yes, the number of hard links for a newly created regular file is 1 by default.

This means only the file itself points to its inode.
If you create additional hard links, this number increases.
For directories, the count is usually 2 or more (for . and its parentâ€™s ..).
So, for a new file, the hard link count is 1.

Q 2) use of ls -n ?

The ls -n command lists files in long format and shows numeric user and group IDs instead of their names.

- The -n option is similar to -l, but displays UID and GID as numbers.
- Useful for seeing the actual user and group IDs, not just their names.
