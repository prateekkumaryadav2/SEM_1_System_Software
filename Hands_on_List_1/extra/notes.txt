Q1) what is file descriptor exactly?
- A file descriptor is a non-negative integer that the operating system uses to identify and access open files or I/O resources (like pipes, sockets, or devices) within a process.
- When you open a file (or another I/O resource), the OS returns a file descriptor.
- File descriptors are used in system calls like read(), write(), and close() to specify which file or resource to operate on.
- Standard file descriptors:
  0: Standard input (stdin)
  1: Standard output (stdout)
  2: Standard error (stderr)
In summary:
A file descriptor is a unique number assigned by the OS to each open file or I/O resource in a process, allowing the program to interact with it.
